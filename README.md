# Proof of Work (SHA1)
Proof of Work concept by hashing SHA1 using OpenCL.

This Proof of Work works by hashing and predicting 4 bytes in SHA1 input.
When this brute-forcer guesses right, it kills all of the processes and threads and prints a successful message.
SHA1 hashing is implemented in OpenCL
